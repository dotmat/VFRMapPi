# VFR Sectional LED Manager

## About
While learning to become a pilot and obtain my VFR / PPL license I had to become very familiar with both the weather and VFR sectional maps. 
Using tools such as https://skyvector.comm,  https://foreflight.com and of course https://aviationweather.gov 
I had to read maps and interpret where and what the weather is doing and specific locations. 

This script is the software portion of the VFR LED Sectional Map.
